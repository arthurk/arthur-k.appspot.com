    <p>I attended the <a href="http://www.pyconuk.org/">PyCon UK 2008</a> in Birmingham about a week ago (12th to 14th September).</p>

<p>One thing I really liked about the conference is that there weren't many people with purely commercial interests around. Most of the attendants were very passionate Python developers who just wanted to meet and learn new stuff.

<h3>Talks</h3>
<p>There were a lot of interesting talks, but if I personally had to choose the most interesting one I would go with <a href="http://www.pyconuk.org/talk_abstracts.html#49">"Core Python Containers -- Under the Hood"</a> from Raymond D. Hettinger.</p>

<p>The talk was basically about the implementation of lists, tuples, dicts, sets and deques. Under the hood Python uses a fixed-length array of pointers and may call realloc() or memcpy() when it grows or shrinks.</p>

<p>To minimize the reallocation calls, Python uses an overallocation strategy for the size of the array, so that it always has some space left.</p>

<p>For example a list with just one item in it will have 4 spaces allocated. If you keep adding items to the list a realloc() gets called for the fifth item and the list will have 8 spaces allocated.</p>

<p>The growth pattern is 0, 4, 8, 16, 25, 35, 46, 58, 72, 88, ...</p>

<p>This is just one example from the talk, there were a lot more in his presentation. If you have some time be sure to check out <a href="http://www.pycon.it/static/pycon2/slides/containers.ppt">this older presentation [ppt]</a>, which looks identical.</p>

<h3>Conference Dinner</h3>
<p>One of the highlights was the conference dinner where <a href="http://www.odyssey.dial.pipex.com/">Andrew Lound</a> gave an awesome presentation about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Society">Lunar Society</a>, which were a group of intellectuals who met during full moon in Birmingham in the 18th century.

<p>Since this was my first time in Birmingham it was quite nice to see a little bit about the history of the city.</p>

<h3>Django Sprint</h3>
<p>On Monday a little Django sprint took place at the conference venue. We were about 10 people sitting in a small circle and hacking away at various tickets. <a href="http://www.jacobian.org/">Jacob</a> did a great job with explaining things so that even I could start working on some tickets.</p>

<p>Oh, if you're the guy who bought snacks for everyone and are reading this: thank you very much.</p>

<p>EuroPython 2009 will also take place in Birmingham and I'm definitely looking forward to it. It's a great city and the people are niceâ€”there's no excuse not to come ;-). See you next year.</p>
<p>PS.: Traditional english breakfast might sound horrible but actually isn't that bad.</p>
